# Develop in a cloud sandbox

## Run your own network:
After setting up your kubernetes cluster, and `kubectl` is configured to talk
to the cluster you just need to run `scripts/create_all`. To delete run
`scripts/delete_all`. The docker images were made against
github.com/swetharepakula/fabric/tree/FAB-6590-poc commit sha: 5829f823a0c1a150933c5005c43d1eed7480fb5c and with the sample config that is in
this repo.

# Privacy Notice
For serviceability needs regarding the number of network activity, IBM has added a mechanism in the ordering service to collect a "pulse" from the networks. The UUID of a network is collected periodically and sent to a monitoring service, there is no blockchain or transaction information or data gathered or accessed. The only purpose is to provide information on activity passing through the ordering service.

The UUID is generated by the network randomly when the orderer comes up and is not attached to any further network information. The UUID is re-generated and old UUID lost whenever the ordering service is restarted.
